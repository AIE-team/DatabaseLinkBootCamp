This is the Code for the bootcamp we did on 24 March, Making a Windows form app with DB grid to display Table using a sql statement 

If you want this to work on your pc you must connect you database (Watch the lecture to see this) and change your SQL statement. 
You should probably do this project your self you lazy f*ck
